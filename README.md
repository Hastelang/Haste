# Haste (The programming language)

Haste is a programming language in the (Insert Greek letter before alpha here) stage of development.

# Why use Haste

Don't, right now. Haste should eventually become a full programming language. And it might eventually rival Rust in terms of correctness and safety, while cutting the learning curve dramatically.

# Docs

Coming soon. (See `./src/tokens.go` for some level of guidence)
